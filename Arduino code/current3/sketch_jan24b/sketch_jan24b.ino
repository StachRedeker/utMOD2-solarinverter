/* About the slope and intercept
 * First you need to know that all the TRMS calucations are done by functions from the library, it's the "inputStats.sigma()" value
 * At first you can display that "inputStats.sigma()" as your TRMS value, then try to measure using it when the input is 0.00A
 * If the measured value is 0 like I got you can keep the intercept as 0, otherwise you'll need to add or substract to make that value equal to 0
 * In other words " remove the offset"
 * Then turn on the power to a known value, for example use a bulb or a led that ou know its power and you already know your voltage, so a little math you'll get the theoritical amps
 * you divide that theory value by the measured value and here you got the slope, now place them or modify them
